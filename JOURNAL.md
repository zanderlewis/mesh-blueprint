## 11/6/2025 12 AM - The Beginning  

Earlier today while I was at work, I thought of the perfect idea to make for Blueprint! Making an alternate internet has been one of my programming dreams, and I came up with the idea of making a local and completely offline internet.

Thus begins `Mesh.

## 11/6/2025 2 PM - Did some research  

I did some research on possible chips that can be used for Mesh. It seems that the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 is the best for Mesh, as it has wifi built in, along with Bluetooth, if I was ever to use it. More importantly, it is really cheap. each Pico is ~$5, making the possible price of each USB A/C chip <$15
